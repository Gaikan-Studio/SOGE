# What is this?

SOGE (Study Only Game Engine) is the game engine made for study purposes at [ITMO.GameDev](https://en.itmo.ru/en/department/509/Game_Development_School.htm) faculty.

# Build engine

To build engine, simply run **GenerateProject.bat** – it'll automatically download and link all the required libraries to the newly generated MSVС project.

Also, be sure to install:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to build dependencies (libraries)
- DirectX Compiler (DXC) or [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) to build shaders
